<p>Operation Pits Healing Heroes is a program designed to improve the lives of some of our nation’s bravest men and women with the help of breed of dog who knows first hand how unfair life can sometimes be. These veterans have given so much of themselves and often come back home only to find life much different than when they left and are forced to live with daily struggles such as disabilities & PTSD. Sometimes what they need more than anything, is a loyal companion that can be there with them through their journey of life after serving in a combat zone. A Pit Bull by nature is one of the most loyal, devoted, and versatile breeds which make them the perfect partner as service and therapy dogs.</p>

<p>Through our years of rescue, rehabilitation and placement of homeless, unwanted, neglected and abused Pit Bulls we have seen firsthand that many of these dogs in need have the heart and mind to be more than just a family pet. They often times have an innate ability to connect with children, the disabled, or the elderly in a way that soothes a person’s soul and can brighten even the darkest day.</p>

<p>Canine candidates for this program will be trained specifically for the needs of their veteran partner.  The program is open to any veteran from any military branch that feels they would benefit from a canine companion and therapy dog. These dogs are trained and partnered with veterans through OPHH free of charge to the veteran.</p>

<p>We hope to improve the lives of the silent sufferers, to help heal the visible and invisible scars, and to make the lives of our brave and honorable veterans just a little bit easier by placing a new guardian with them to join their civilian journey. We feel Pit Bulls, above any other breed, can relate to being misunderstood, misrepresented, and alone just like many of our returning heroes.  We believe with strong conviction that this program will make a difference not just in the lives of the Pit Bulls we save, but also in the lives of America’s heroes one partnership at a time.</p>

<p>OPHH is a special program of Guardian Pit Bull Rescue, a 501c3 breed specific rescue in Houston, Texas. Founded in 2010 Guardian Pit Bull Rescue, GPBR, has served Houston and the Texas area Pit Bulls through education, advocacy, and rescue.</p>

<p>Over the years many of our rescues have displayed an innate ability to be more than just a family companion. They’ve shown the natural ability to help heal a person emotionally, and with the proper training, these rescues can learn to be certified therapy and service dogs.</p>
